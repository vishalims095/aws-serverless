# aws-serverless
## Serverless is a way to describe the services, practices, and strategies that enable you to build more agile applications so you can innovate and respond to change faster. With serverless computing, infrastructure management tasks like capacity provisioning and patching are handled by AWS, so you can focus on only writing code that serves your customers. Serverless services like AWS Lambda come with automatic scaling, built-in high availability, and a pay-for-value billing model. Lambda is an event-driven compute service that enables you to run code in response to events from over 200 natively-integrated AWS and SaaS sources - all without managing any servers. 
# Configuration
## npm i serverless --g
## serverless config credentials --provider aws --key "authkey" --secret 'secratekey'
